Data ingestion, fraud-detection engine, and feature pipeline for **LedgerLens** — a hybrid on-chain fraud detection system for the Stellar DEX that combines **Benford's Law digit analysis** with **ensemble machine learning** to detect wash trading and artificial volume.

> *"On a transparent ledger, every transaction is visible. LedgerLens makes them legible."*

## Overview

This repository holds the data and detection layer of LedgerLens: the pipelines that pull trade data from the Stellar Horizon API, compute Benford's Law anomaly metrics, extract on-chain ML features, train and run the ensemble classifiers, and produce the **LedgerLens Risk Score (0–100)** consumed by the API, dashboard, and Soroban contract layer.

## The Problem

Wash trading — simultaneously buying and selling the same asset to artificially inflate volume — is one of the most pervasive forms of market manipulation in DeFi. Stellar's 3–5 second settlement finality and sub-cent fees make wash trading cheap to execute at scale, while the sheer volume of on-chain activity makes manual detection impossible. No production-grade, open-source detection system exists for the Stellar DEX — LedgerLens fills that gap.

## What This Repo Does

- **Ingests** — Streams and bulk-loads trade history, order book events, and account activity from the Stellar Horizon API
- **Detects** — Computes Benford's Law anomaly metrics (chi-square, per-digit Z-scores, MAD) per wallet, per asset, and per trading pair across rolling time windows
- **Scores** — Extracts 30+ on-chain features and runs ensemble ML classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to produce a 0–100 risk score per wallet/asset pair
- **Explains** — Generates SHAP-based interpretability output so every risk score is auditable

## Benford's Law on the Blockchain

Benford's Law states that in many naturally occurring numerical datasets, the leading digit 1 appears ~30.1% of the time, declining to ~4.6% for digit 9. Genuine trading activity produces a wide, unbiased spread of transaction sizes that conforms to this distribution. Wash trading — typically driven by bots using fixed lot sizes, round numbers, or algorithmically generated amounts — deviates systematically from it.

LedgerLens applies three Benford metrics over rolling time windows (1h, 4h, 24h, 7d, 30d):

| Metric | What it measures |
|---|---|
| **Chi-square statistic** | Whether the overall digit distribution deviates significantly from Benford's expected distribution |
| **Z-score (per digit)** | Whether any individual digit (1–9) appears with significantly higher or lower frequency than expected |
| **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)** | A composite measure of distributional divergence; values above 0.015 indicate non-conformity |

Benford signals alone aren't definitive — legitimate high-frequency market makers can also produce non-Benford distributions — which is why they're combined with the ML layer below.

## Machine Learning Layer

### Features (30+, grouped by category)

**Benford Features (15)**
- Chi-square, Z-score, and MAD for transaction amounts across 5 rolling time windows

**Trade Pattern Features**
- Counterparty concentration ratio (fraction of volume with a single counterparty)
- Round-trip trade frequency (trades returning assets to the originating wallet within N ledgers)
- Self-matching rate (buy/sell orders from wallets sharing funding sources)
- Order cancellation rate and timing patterns

**Volume and Timing Features**
- Volume-to-unique-counterparty ratio
- Intra-minute trade clustering coefficient
- Off-hours activity ratio
- Volume spike frequency relative to rolling baseline

**Wallet Graph Features**
- Funding source similarity score
- Network centrality within trading cluster graphs
- Account age at time of trading activity

### Models

| Model | Role |
|---|---|
| **Random Forest** | Stable baseline; handles missing features gracefully |
| **XGBoost** | Primary classifier; strongest performance on tabular on-chain data |
| **LightGBM** | High-speed inference for real-time scoring |

Models are trained with **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance and evaluated using **AUC-ROC**, **Precision-Recall AUC**, and **F1-score**. SHAP values provide interpretable explanations for every risk score.

### Adversarial robustness

A sophisticated operator who reverse-engineers the scoring system could perturb
their on-chain footprint just enough to stay below the alert threshold. The
`detection/adversarial/` package quantifies that attack surface: it runs
**FGSM** and **PGD** (Madry et al., 2018) evasion attacks — estimating feature
gradients by finite differences against the tree ensemble's continuous score —
and reports the evasion success rate, the minimum L-inf perturbation per
feature, and the most vulnerable features. **Adversarial-training augmentation**
then retrains on PGD-perturbed wash examples and measures the AUC-ROC gain on a
perturbed test set. See `scripts/run_adversarial_eval.py`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install
# (equivalent to: pip install -r requirements.txt)

# Generate a synthetic labelled dataset and train the ensemble
python -m scripts.generate_synthetic_dataset --output data/synthetic_dataset.parquet
python -m detection.model_training --data-path data/synthetic_dataset.parquet

# Run the full detection pipeline
python run_pipeline.py
```

### `run_pipeline.py` flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--since <ISO date>` | Only load trades from this date onward (default: all available) |
| `--no-persist` | Skip writing scored wallets to `RISK_SCORE_DB_URL` |
| `--no-orderbook` | Skip loading order-book events (faster; `order_cancellation_rate` stays `0`) |
| `--submit-onchain` | Submit flagged wallets' `RiskScore` to the `ledgerlens-score` contract via `integrations/contract_client.py` |
| `--dry-run` | Run all pipeline stages but skip every write — no DB persistence and no on-chain submission (implies `--no-persist`; silently skips `--submit-onchain`). Flagged wallets are still printed. |

### `scripts/`

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for `generate_synthetic_dataset.py` usage —
a synthetic labelled feature matrix matching `build_feature_matrix`'s schema, useful for
local training/demo/tests without live Horizon data.

## Development

```bash
make install   # pip install -r requirements.txt
make lint      # ruff check .
make format    # black .
make test      # pytest
make run       # python run_pipeline.py
```

## Organization Map

This section orients agents and contributors working across the LedgerLens
organization. It describes how the six repos fit together, what each one
owns, and the shared contracts/interfaces that let them be developed
independently while staying integrated.

### The Six Repositories

| Repo | Role | Primary stack |
|---|---|---|
| **`.github`** | Org-wide config: shared GitHub Actions workflows, issue/PR templates, CODEOWNERS, security policy | YAML / Actions |
| **`ledgerlens-data`** *(this repo)* | Ingestion + detection: pulls Stellar DEX trade data, computes Benford's Law metrics and ML features, trains/runs the ensemble, produces the **LedgerLens Risk Score** | Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, SHAP) |
| **`ledgerlens-core`** | Shared types, schemas, and SDK code used by `api`, `dashboard`, and `contract` (e.g. `RiskScore`, asset pair identifiers, scoring constants) | TypeScript / Python (shared package) |
| **`ledgerlens-api`** | Public REST API — serves risk scores, alerts, asset rankings; reads from this repo's output store and the on-chain contract | TypeScript (FastAPI/Express-style) |
| **`ledgerlens-dashboard`** | Web dashboard — visualizes risk scores, flagged wallets/pairs, SHAP explanations | React/Vite |
| **`ledgerlens-contract`** (`ledgerlens-score`) | Soroban smart contract — on-chain truth layer for risk scores (`submit_score`, `get_score`) | Rust / Soroban SDK |

ledgerlens-core: shared types/SDK imported by api, dashboard, contract clients
.github: CI/CD workflows + policies shared by all of the above
```

**Summary of the handoff points:**

1. **`ledgerlens-data` → `ledgerlens-api`**: this repo's pipeline output (the
   `RiskScore` feature/score records from `detection/model_inference.py`)
   is written to a shared store (`RISK_SCORE_DB_URL`). `ledgerlens-api`
   reads from that store to serve `/score/{wallet}/{pair}`,
   `/alerts/recent`, and `/assets/risk-ranking`.
2. **`ledgerlens-data` / `ledgerlens-api` → `ledgerlens-contract`**: an
   authorized service account calls `submit_score(wallet, asset_pair,
   score, timestamp)` to register scores on-chain. Any contract can then
   call `get_score(wallet, asset_pair)` permissionlessly.
3. **`ledgerlens-core` → everyone**: defines the canonical `RiskScore`
   shape, asset-pair identifier format, and risk thresholds so all repos
   agree on field names and units without copy-pasting types.
4. **`.github` → everyone**: shared CI workflows (lint/test/build per
   language), required status checks, and release automation.

### Shared Contracts

These are the data shapes and conventions every repo must agree on. If you
change one of these in `ledgerlens-data`, update `ledgerlens-core` and open
linked issues/PRs in the consuming repos.

#### `RiskScore` (on-chain + API shape)

```rust
pub struct RiskScore {
    pub score: u32,          // 0-100; higher = more suspicious
    pub benford_flag: bool,  // True if Benford anomaly detected
    pub ml_flag: bool,       // True if ML classifier flagged
    pub timestamp: u64,      // Ledger timestamp of last update
    pub confidence: u32,     // Model confidence 0-100
}
```

Produced in this repo by `detection/model_inference.py::RiskScorer.score()`.
Mirrors `ledgerlens-contract`'s `submit_score` payload and
`ledgerlens-api`'s `/score/{wallet}/{pair}` response.

#### Asset pair identifier

Format: `CODE:ISSUER` (e.g. `USDC:GA5Z...`), or `XLM:native` for the native
asset. See `ingestion/data_models.py::Asset.pair_id()`. Used consistently
across the API path parameters, contract `Symbol` arguments, and dashboard
routing.

#### Risk thresholds

- `RISK_SCORE_FLAG_THRESHOLD` (default `70`) — score at or above this is
  surfaced as "flagged" in the API and dashboard.
- `MAD_NONCONFORMITY_THRESHOLD` (`0.015`) — Benford MAD above this sets
  `benford_flag = true` (Nigrini, 2012).

#### Feature schema

The 30+ feature columns produced by
`detection/feature_engineering.py::build_feature_matrix` are the training
input for `detection/model_training.py`. Any new feature column must be
added to both the training pipeline and `model_inference.py`'s
`FEATURE_COLUMNS_EXCLUDE`-aware scoring path, and documented in
`ledgerlens-core` if other repos need to display feature attributions
(SHAP output from `detection/shap_explainer.py`).

#### Known gaps / TODOs

- Wallet funding-graph features (`funding_source_similarity`,
  `network_centrality`) are implemented in `detection/wallet_graph.py`, but
  `run_pipeline.py` doesn't build a `funding_graph` yet — there's no
  ingestion source for `AccountActivity.funding_account` data. Wiring this
  up requires an account-creation/funding event loader (a candidate next
  feature).
- `model_training.py` trains on `scripts/generate_synthetic_dataset.py`'s
  synthetic data by default; the real labelled wash-trade dataset is still
  the "Open dataset release" roadmap item.
- `run_pipeline.py`'s persisted `asset_pair` is a combined label across all
  `WATCHED_ASSET_PAIRS` (`watched_pairs_label()`), not a per-pair
  attribution — the feature matrix is currently built across all pairs
  together. Per-pair feature matrices would need per-pair trade filtering
  upstream of `build_feature_matrix`.
- `--submit-onchain` assumes a deployed `ledgerlens-score` contract and a
  funded `LEDGERLENS_SUBMITTER_SECRET`; it has unit test coverage via mocks
  but hasn't been exercised against a live Soroban network from this repo.

When picking up one of these, check whether `ledgerlens-core` already
defines the relevant shared type before inventing a new one.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- [ ] Stellar Horizon API ingestion pipeline (historical + streaming)
- [ ] Benford's Law engine for on-chain transaction amounts
- [ ] Initial feature engineering from SDEX trade data
- [ ] Baseline ML model training on historical wash trade patterns
- [ ] Internal testing on Stellar Testnet

### Phase 2 — Core Product
- [ ] Full ensemble model training and evaluation
- [ ] SHAP interpretability integration
- [ ] Public REST API (v1) with rate limiting
- [ ] Web dashboard (beta)

### Phase 3 — Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] Mainnet deployment
- [ ] SDK for protocol integrations (Python + JavaScript)
- [ ] Open dataset release: labelled SDEX wash trade patterns

## Why This Matters

A DEX where volume figures cannot be trusted is one that institutional participants and serious traders will avoid. LedgerLens is an **open-source public good** — its scores, methodology, and training data are fully transparent and auditable, and will always be free to query.

## Contributing

We're actively looking for collaborators with experience in:

- Python backend development and ML pipeline engineering
- On-chain data analysis and blockchain forensics
- Stellar / Soroban smart contract development (Rust)
- DeFi protocol integration
