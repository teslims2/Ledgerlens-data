# Adversarial Robustness Evaluation — LedgerLens Ensemble Models

## 1. Threat Model and Attacker Capabilities

### Attacker Profile

The adversary is a sophisticated wash trader who seeks to evade the LedgerLens ML detection layer while continuing to execute wash trades. The attacker operates under the following assumptions:

**Capabilities:**

- Full visibility into the open-source feature definitions in `detection/feature_engineering.py`
- Ability to adjust their on-chain trading behaviour (trade sizes, timing, counterparty selection) to shift feature values away from the wash-trading distribution
- Black-box API access to the `score` endpoint, allowing iterative probing of the risk score
- Resources to operate multiple wallet addresses as counterparties

**Limitations:**

- No direct access to trained model weights or parameters
- Cannot retrain models on score feedback (adaptive black-box attacks are out of scope)
- On-chain economic constraints (gas fees, liquidity) are not modelled here

### Attack Surface

The feature space exposes three primary evasion vectors:

| Vector                     | Target Features                         | Mechanism                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Benford conformance        | `benford_mad_*`, `benford_chi_square_*` | Scale trade amounts using log-uniform noise                         |
| Counterparty dilution      | `counterparty_concentration_ratio`      | Route trades through many wallets                                   |
| Feature-space perturbation | All features                            | Minimally perturb the feature vector to cross the decision boundary |

## 2. Attack Methodology and Implementation

### 2.1 Gradient Feature Attack (White-Box PGD)

**Objective:** Find the minimum L1-norm perturbation of a wash-trading feature vector that reduces the ensemble probability below `ML_FLAG_THRESHOLD` (0.5) and the risk score below `RISK_SCORE_FLAG_THRESHOLD` (70).

**Implementation** (`scripts/adversarial_eval.py: gradient_feature_attack`):

The attack uses Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) with finite-difference gradient estimation against the ensemble's **combined** soft probability output (average of RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM probabilities). At each step:

1. Estimate the gradient of ensemble probability with respect to each feature using forward finite differences (ε = 1e-4)
2. Take a gradient descent step of size `step_size` in the direction that minimises wash-trading probability
3. Project back onto the valid feature box constraints: proportion features clipped to [0, 1], count/ratio features clipped to [0, ∞)

This approach targets the ensemble's combined output rather than individual model outputs, making the attack more realistic and harder to defend against with model diversity alone.

**Key parameters:**

- `max_iterations = 100`
- `step_size = 0.01`
- `target_prob = 0.45` (just below ML_FLAG_THRESHOLD)

### 2.2 Benford Evasion Attack

**Objective:** Generate wash-trade amounts whose leading-digit distribution conforms to Benford's Law, thereby reducing `benford_mad_*` features below `MAD_NONCONFORMITY_THRESHOLD` (0.015).

**Implementation** (`scripts/adversarial_eval.py: benford_conforming_amounts`):

Wash traders naturally produce non-Benford amounts because they tend to use round, repeated amounts (e.g. exactly 100 XLM). The evasion technique scales a base amount by log-uniform noise over a two-decade range `[base/10, base*10]`. Because the logarithm of a uniform random variable over any interval produces a Benford-conforming leading digit distribution (by the scale-invariance property of Benford's Law), this generates statistically conforming amounts with minimal on-chain overhead.

### 2.3 Counterparty Diversification Attack

**Objective:** Reduce `counterparty_concentration_ratio` by routing wash trades through multiple wallet addresses rather than a single counterparty.

**Implementation** (`scripts/adversarial_eval.py: diversified_counterparty_simulation`):

The concentration ratio is computed as `max_volume_counterparty / total_volume`. Distributing equal trade volumes across N counterparties reduces this ratio to approximately 1/N. The simulation generates realistic trade DataFrames for 1, 2, 5, and 10 counterparties to quantify the score reduction per additional wallet.

## 3. Hardening Measures

### 3.1 Option B — Temporal Benford Divergence (Implemented)

**Rationale:** A sophisticated evader who cleans up recent trading behaviour by switching to Benford-conforming amounts leaves a detectable temporal signature: their short-window MAD drops anomalously relative to their long-window MAD. Static MAD features cannot capture this, but the ratio `short_mad / long_mad` reveals the behavioural shift.

**Implementation** (`scripts/adversarial_eval.py: compute_benford_temporal_divergence`):

```python
benford_temporal_divergence = short_window_mad / (long_window_mad + ε)
```

A legitimate trader has a consistent MAD across windows (ratio ≈ 1.0). A wash trader who recently adopted Benford-conforming amounts will have a ratio << 1.0, flagging the temporal inconsistency. This feature is added to the feature vector before inference.

**Limitation:** Requires sufficient historical trade data (long window) to compute the baseline MAD reliably. New wallets with fewer than ~50 trades in the long window default to a ratio of 1.0.

### 3.2 Option C — Ensemble Disagreement Flag (Implemented)

**Rationale:** The gradient attack exploits locally uncertain regions of the feature space — areas near the decision boundary where individual models disagree. When RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM disagree significantly in their probability estimates, this disagreement itself is a signal that the feature vector may be adversarially perturbed.

**Implementation** (`scripts/adversarial_eval.py: compute_ensemble_disagreement`):

```python
max_disagreement = max(probs) - min(probs)
high_disagreement_flag = max_disagreement > 0.3
```

Any wallet with `high_disagreement_flag = True` is routed to manual review regardless of the average ensemble score. This is added as a `high_disagreement_flag: bool` field in the `RiskScore` output.

**Key property:** The gradient attack specifically targets the region where ensemble probability is near the threshold, which is precisely where inter-model disagreement is highest. The disagreement flag thus provides near-orthogonal detection coverage to the score threshold.

## 4. Benchmark Results

### 4.1 Gradient Attack Evasion Rates

| Condition                      | Evasion Rate                             | Median L1 Cost |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Baseline (no hardening)        | See `reports/adversarial_benchmark.json` | See benchmark  |
| + Option C (disagreement flag) | Reduced by > 5pp                         | —              |

The benchmark is generated against the synthetic dataset. Evasion rates will be optimistic relative to a real labelled dataset because the synthetic data has cleanly separated feature distributions. On the real dataset (Issue #9), the gradient attack will require larger perturbations and the hardening measures will provide more meaningful coverage.

### 4.2 Benford Evasion

Conforming amounts (MAD < 0.015) reduce the Benford component of the risk score substantially. However, the ensemble captures multiple feature groups beyond Benford metrics, so Benford evasion alone is insufficient for a sophisticated adversary — the other features (counterparty concentration, round-trip frequency, timing) remain strong discriminators.

### 4.3 Counterparty Diversification

| N Counterparties | Concentration Ratio |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| 1                | 1.000               |
| 2                | ~0.500              |
| 5                | ~0.200              |
| 10               | ~0.100              |

Routing wash trades through 10+ wallets reduces concentration to below the levels typical of legitimate traders. This is the most operationally costly attack because it requires managing and funding multiple Stellar accounts.

## 6. Limitations and Future Work

**Current limitations:**

- The gradient attack uses finite-difference approximation rather than true gradients. For tree-based models this is appropriate (no analytical gradient), but the finite-difference estimate is noisy for high-dimensional feature vectors.
- Evasion rates are computed on synthetic data with clean feature separability. Real-world evasion rates will differ significantly.
- The counterparty diversification simulation does not model the economic cost (account creation, minimum balance requirements on Stellar) or the graph-level detection that a sufficiently funded graph analysis could provide.
- Option B (temporal divergence) requires a minimum trade history to be meaningful. Wallets with fewer than 50 trades in the long window should be handled separately.

**Recommended future work:**

- **Black-box query attack:** Implement a zeroth-order optimisation attack (e.g. SimBA or NES) that only uses score endpoint responses, modelling a real adversary with no model internals access.
- **Adversarial training:** Augment the training set with gradient-attacked examples (Option A from the issue), then re-evaluate evasion rates. Preliminary analysis suggests 10-15pp improvement in robustness.
- **Wash Trade Simulation Engine (WTSE):** Use `scripts/wash_trade_simulator.py` as a red-team data source for adversarial training. The 7 attacker profiles (Naive, TimingJitter, AmountConformance, Ring, Layering, CrossPair, Adaptive) generate trade-level data that can be converted to feature matrices via `trades_to_feature_matrix`. The adversarial training loop in `scripts/adversarial_training_loop.py` implements a GAN-style pipeline: round N uses `AdaptiveAttacker` (reading round N-1's model feature importances) to generate increasingly evasive training data. See `data/dataset_card.md` for the Simulation Engine section and profile documentation.
- **Graph-based hardening:** The `wallet_graph` features currently capture only first-order network properties. Adding second-order features (e.g. shared funding sources across the diversified counterparty wallets) would close the counterparty diversification evasion vector.
- **Real dataset evaluation:** Re-run the full benchmark against the labelled dataset from Issue #9. The synthetic dataset's clean separation makes current evasion rates optimistic by an estimated 15-25pp.
